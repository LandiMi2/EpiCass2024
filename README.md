### DNA methylation profiling in plants



The [Epicass](https://www.iita.org/iita-project/identification-of-epigenetic-variations-influencing-viral-resistance-and-yield-in-cassava-farmers-fields/) and [CassavaNet4Dev](https://www.iita.org/iita-project/cassavanet4dev-in-a-race-to-prevent-hunger-cassava-bioinformatics-for-african-cassava-biotechnology/) projects (Swedish Research Council) in collaboration with the [COST Action EPI-CATCH](https://www.cost.eu/actions/CA19125/) (CA19125 - EPIgenetic mechanisms of Crop Adaptation To Climate cHange) organise and fund the third Advanced Bioinformatics Workshop on NGS data analysis with special focus on DNA methylation profiling.


The course is organised by the:

- Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU), Uppsala, Sweden
- International Institute of Tropical Agriculture, Ibadan, Nigeria and Nairobi, Kenya
- University of Fribourg, Fribourg, Switzerland
- CNR Institute of Sustainable Plant Protection, Bari, Italy
- CNR Institute of Biomedical Technologies, Bari, Italy

with the support of

- Bio & Emerging Technology Institute, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia
- Agricultural University of Athens, Athens, Greece

The course will take place in six classrooms in parallel:
- Addis Ababa, Ethiopia
- Athens, Greece
- Bari, Italy
- Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania
- Ibadan, Nigeria
- Nairobi, Kenya
- Uppsala, Sweden

and will be guided by local specialists and by online teachers.

The course is addressed to researchers (students and scientists) with bioinformatics background and some basic knowledge in NGS data analysis.

By the end of the course, participants will be able to:
1. Use Linux command line as a tool for data analysis 
3. Perform QC assessment on NGS data  
5. Perform mapping using NGS data 
6. Perform DNA methylation profiling in plants
